       <p>Located at a distance of 15 kms from Thodupuzha and 60 kms from Kottayam, Elaveezha Poonchira is a small quaint hill station. Perched at a height of 3200 feet above the sea level, it can be reached by a jeep ride through the unpaved rocky mountainous terrain. Literally translating to a ‘flowery lake where no leaves fall’, the place has acres of barren land without any plantation or trees with a perennial lake ‘Poonchira’. The area receives heavy rainfall, and the entire valley turns into a river during monsoons.</p>
