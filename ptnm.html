                  <p>t’s one of the most breathtaking places to visit in Pathanamthitta. It is a confluence of three rivers - the Pamba River Manimala River and the Achankovil River, all deeply connected with Sabarimala. A dip into the refreshing waters will definitely wipe away your tiredness, and maybe, a few sins here and there. </p>

               <p>The Konni Forest reserves are a great place to spend a day with your family if you’re visiting Pathanamthitta, especially because it’s a very well-organised forest resort with excellent guides willing to take you around the place. If you can visit the elephant training centre where they break in wild elephants. Or, ride the bowl-shaped boats. Top tip- the bowl boats may get your head spinning, so better ride it on an empty stomach. </p>

               <img src="images/ptnmthta/Aranmula.jpg" alt="">
             <p>Aranmula is famous for its Aranmula Kannadi (metal mirrors), the centuries’ old Sree Krishna Temple, the unique ritualistic feast of `Vallasadya,’ and famed Aranmula Boat Race and the list goes on. It gets its name from the centuries-old Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple (dedicated to Sree Krishna) on the banks of the holy River Pamba, a virtual hotbed of devotees. The murals, carvings and paintings here have inspired much awe and interest. It is also the venue for the Aranmula Vallasadya, a ritual offering to the deity Lord Parthasarathy in which the oarsmen of the snake boats are offered a feast. With over 70 dishes it is probably one of the largest vegetarian feasts in India. (Watch the video of Vallasadya)</p>
